# Robotique CRC Robotics Judging App

# Retired

Please note that this project has run its course and has been retired from active use by the CRC. As such, it will no longer be maintained, and pull requests will no longer be accepted.

It's also quite outdated, using newly-emergent patterns for PHP5 in 2013. Since then, a lot has changed, and this project has not kept up. It probably shouldn't be used as a model for current best practices.

# Quickstart

- Create the database schema with `scaffold.sql`
- Install the application somewhere with PHP 5 and Apache2

# Introduction

The Robotique CRC Robitics competition is about more than just robots: it aims to bring together multisicsiplinary teams of students with diverse interests and talents, ranging from engineering to film to design and writing.

In addition to building a robot to play a sport, teams can submit:
- a video about their team, school and design process
- a web site about their team, school, and design process

These are judged across three categories: web is judged on technical design (Web award) and writing (Journalism), and the video is judged on its own as a whole.
